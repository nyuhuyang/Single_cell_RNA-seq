I have difficulty to reproduct the code in monocle manual
HSMM<-estimateDispersions(HSMM)
disp_table <- dispersionTable(HSMM)

I updata OS, R and R studio, didn't work.
Finally I realize Ctrapnell mentioned this in his github that:
ctrapnell commented on Jun 7 2016
 estimateDispersions only makes sense right now for negbinomial and negbinomial.size expression families.

https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle-release/issues/5

So I can changed expressionFamily=negbinomial.size() and add  lowerDetectionLimit=0.5 while build newCellData
It works.
